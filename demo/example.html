    WASHINGTON — The Senate passed the most sweeping tax rewrite in decades early Saturday, with Republicans lining up
    to approve an overhaul that will touch almost every corner of the United States economy, affecting families, small
    business owners and multinational corporations, with the biggest benefits flowing to the highest-earning Americans.

    Senators voted 51-49, as Republicans approved the nearly 500-page bill in the early morning hours after lawmakers
    received a rewritten version, which contained significant changes from the original bill that passed two Senate
    panels last month along party lines. The last-minute revisions prompted an outcry from Democrats, who said it was
    impossible — and irresponsible — for lawmakers to read and digest a significant piece of legislation in such a short
    period of time.
